    <b>About the Semester Curriculum</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://shodor.org/">Shodor</a> is coordinating a curriculum development effort for which we are recruiting participants from
    institutions across the United States to fill a variety of roles (curriculum developers,
    testers, workshop instructors, and workshop participants). 
    <b> The Blue Waters Parallel Computational STEM Curriculum Capstone </b> (or, simply, 
    <b>"the Capstone"</b>) aims to prepare faculty and professional staff to teach applied parallel modeling and
    simulation by incorporating the materials and lessons learned from the successful 
    <a href="../../institute" where="_blank">Blue Waters Intern Petascale Institute</a> that has been conducted multiple times over the last ten years. 
  </p>
  <p>
    What has set the Petascale Institute apart from other efforts is that it starts with 
    <a href="../../modules" where="_blank">working models solving problems in real science</a> that cover the continuum of multi-core/many-core technologies as exemplified by Blue Waters
    (OpenMP, MPI, OpenACC, CUDA, hybrid). Instead of teaching these from an abstract, theoretical
    point, we have exploited the basic motifs used in real scientific code to teach undergraduate
    and graduate students the basics of applied parallel modeling and simulation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the Capstone effort is to update the Petascale Institute materials to become more
    useful for preparing undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to help faculty and
    professional staff to integrate the materials into their own courses, student programs, REUs,
    workshops, and institutes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is a component of the Blue Waters education initiatives at the University of
    Illinois, funded by the National Science Foundation.

    <b>How to use these materials</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    These resources can be helpful both for 
    <i>instructors</i> looking to integrate parts of parallel computing material into their course or in developing
    their own parallel computing course and for 
    <i>students</i> looking to learn more about parallel computing in general. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For instructors: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        These materials are meant to provide 
        <i>example</i> lessons that you can incorporate into your own course. We designed each lesson to take ~25
        minutes so you can easily fit two topics into a 50 minute or 75 minute lecture. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, Shodor plans to host a 
        <b>semesterly webinar</b> for instructors looking to develop their parallel computing course. The webinars will be in
        August, September and December and more information on these webinars is TBD. If you are
        interested, please fill out the contact form at the bottom of any lesson page. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For students: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        Watch our videos example lectures! Our developers put a lot of time into making these to
        help you understand the concepts more thoroughly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Go through our example code and example lesson plans/lecture notes, and give us feedback in
        our 
        <a href="../../../feedback" where="_blank">feedback form</a>. 
      </li>
    </ul>
