  By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Demonstrate an understanding of dynamic programming approach to the Longest
    Common Sequence problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show why filling the cost table by rows (or columns) creates a data
    dependency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show how the data dependency was avoided by filling the cost table
    diagonally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrate that using OpenMP makes the diagonal cost table filling function
    parallel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show how the parallel version executes quicker than the serial version for
    the larger data set.
  </li>
</ul>
