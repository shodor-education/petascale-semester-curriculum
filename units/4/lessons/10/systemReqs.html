  The example code includes two C files, a serial algorithm and a parallel
  algorithm for the SA and EBSA algorithms, respectively. Students are not
  required to modify the code for the purpose of this activity, but they will
  need resources on which to run the code.

  Resources should include a machine capable of compiling and running OpenMP
  code on multiple processors.
