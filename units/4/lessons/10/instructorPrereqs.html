<p>
  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have prior knowledge of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming in C</li>
  <li>Max/Min Problems</li>
  <li>OpenMP
    <ul>
      <li>Concerns over race conditions and shared memory</li>
      <li>Definition of concurrency and loop carried dependency</li>
      <li>OpenMP format for "parallel for" loop with "private" clauses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<p>
  Additionally, it will be useful for instructors to review max/min problems in
  general, the problem of global versus local minimization, the
  Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and the use of the simulated annealing problem
  in practice in order to be able to answer student questions.
