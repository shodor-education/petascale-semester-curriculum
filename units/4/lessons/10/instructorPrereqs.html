<p>
This activity is geared towards students who have begun learning OpenMP and are moving towards examples that will allow them to put skills in practice.
</p>
<p>
Students should have prior knowledge of
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Programming in C</li>
	<li>Max/Min Problems</li>
	<li>OpenMP</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Concerns over race conditions and shared memory</li>
		<li>Definition of concurrency and loop carried dependency</li>
		<li>OpenMP format for parallel for loop with private clauses</li> 
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, it will be useful for instructors to review max/min problems in general, the problem of global versus local minimization, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and the use of the simulated annealing problem in practice in order to be able to answer student questions.
