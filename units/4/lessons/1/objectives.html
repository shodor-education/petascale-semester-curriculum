After completing this lesson, students will be able to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Define a race condition and give an example where it occurs in everyday life</li>
	<li>Use the parallel for pragma of OpenMP to parallelize for loops</li>
	<li>Identify and resolve the following types of race conditions in parallel for loops: </li>
	<ul>
		<li>A variable that should not be shared between iterations (resolved by adding a private declaration to the pragma or moving the variable declaration into the loop)</li>
		<li>A variable used in a reduction operation (resolved by adding a reduction pragma)</li> 
	</ul> 
</ul>
