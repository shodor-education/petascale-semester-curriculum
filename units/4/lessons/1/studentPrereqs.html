<p>The lesson assumes that students understand for loops and variable scoping in C.  They should also understand the idea of parallel execution using threads.  The latter can  be massaged by making this their first experience with multi-threading, but then the material would have to be supplemented with an explanation of this programming model.  A Fortran version of the lesson should also be easy to create since OpenMP is also available in Fortran.</p>
