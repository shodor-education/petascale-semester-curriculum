<p>
  Before starting this lesson, students should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of "for" loops and variable scoping in C.</li>
  <li>
    Understanding of the idea of parallel execution using threads. This can be
    massaged by making this their first experience with multi-threading, but
    then the material would have to be supplemented with an explanation of this
    programming model. A Fortran version of the lesson should also be easy to
    create since OpenMP is also available in Fortran.
  </li>
</ul>
