    To use this lesson, youâ€™ll need a system that can compile C programs using OpenMP and view the resulting .ppm file.
    The program must be run in parallel in order to observe the race condition. The timing results reported in this
    lesson are from a 2.1GHz AMD Opteron with 16 cores running and code compiled using gcc 9.2.1 on Fedora Linux version
    31. That said, I have run equivalent code on dual and quad core systems previously and observed the race condition.
