  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of "for" loops and variable scoping in C.</li>
  <li>Understanding of the idea of parallel execution using threads.</li>
  <li>
    Familiarity with the OpenMP pragmas used ("parallel for" with "private"
    and "reduce"), as well as the concepts of race conditions and reductions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to explain the Mandelbrot set and how the given code corresponds
    to the definition; this would be potentially helpful, though it is not
    strictly necessary.
  </li>
</ul>
