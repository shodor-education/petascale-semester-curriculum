  Before starting this lesson, students should have familiarity with C
  programming. This is an exercise designed to have the students test knowledge
  of implementing a parallel for loop in OpenMP. Students should be prepared to
  analyze a nested loop to determine whether there exists a loop carried
  dependency in either the inner or outer loop.
