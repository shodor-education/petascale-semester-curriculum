  "description": "This lesson focuses on transforming a floating-point number image cube into a movie loop animation. Images are generated using a two-dimensional time-dependent partial differential equation scientific application solving for acoustic waves. The time-dependent partial differential equation is solved, and in the process a file is written to generate a visual animation. The program results are presented in a grayscale ImageMagik movie loop. A conversion program converts the movie frame of floating-point numbers into a grayscale .png file.",
