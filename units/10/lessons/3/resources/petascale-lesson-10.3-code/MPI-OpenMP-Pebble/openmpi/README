   Pebble Processing  -- making a movie loop 
                      -- run some version of code..

1)   four basic codes exist in this lesson

       1) pebble.f                    scalar code version
       2) pebble_openmp.f             openmp version
       3) pebble_mpi.f                mpi version
       4) pebble_openmpimp.f          mpi and openmp version

     ALL  solve the acoustic wave equation on a two dimensional grid.
     ALL  run for several hundred time steps.
     ALL  generate output files in the data directory.
     ALL  produce a movie loop file that can be post processed into
          a GraphicsMagick animation.

     The directory mimage has a post processing routine: tpebO.c
         which transforms the data/*.dat files into data/*.png files.

     These data/pebble*png are in sequence and if you use GraphicsMagick tools
     you can create a visual movie of pebble in the pond waves.

     The program sequence follows:

     run these scripts in MPI-OpenMP-Pebble

     ./clean.sh

     ./run_pebble.sh

     cd ../mimage

     ./tpebO

     cd ../MPI-OpenMP-Pebble

     ./runpmovie.sh

     Now you should have a movie from graphicsmagick.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
     If you run the MPI code instead you use the same sequence of scripts.

     run these scripts in MPI-OpenMP-Pebble

     ./clean.sh

     ./run_pebble_mpi.sh

     cd ../mimage

     ./tpebO

     cd ../MPI-OpenMP-Pebble

     ./runpmovie.sh

     Now you should have a movie from graphicsmagick.



---------------- Programs for testing ideas ----------------

----------------- Gray Scale Pixel Example -----------------

To develop gray scale maps from floating point numbers,
two test codes are availble cfrgb.c and cmap.f.

Using the run scripts runcfrgb or runcmap tables of floating point
numbers bounded by a max postive and max negative number are
converts into a list of gray scale pixels.  


----------------- Examine Pebble_MPI movie files -----------

Once a Pebble_MPI run is complete, the data files are stored in
the data directory.  

There are three files.
 
pebble.hdr
pebble.mvlp
pebble.filenames

If you run cmovie.c using the bash script runcmovie, then an analysis of each
movie frame maximum positve and maximum negative number is generated.

A listing of the filenames for each movie frame is presented.

cmovie only reads these files for you to inspect.

----------------- Examine Pebble_MPI movie hdr file --------

Once a Pebble_MPI run is complete, the data files are stored in
the data directory.  

There are three files.
 
pebble.hdr
pebble.mvlp
pebble.filenames

If you run cmoviehead.c using the bash script runcmoviehead,
the data from the pebble.hdr file is printed out.
