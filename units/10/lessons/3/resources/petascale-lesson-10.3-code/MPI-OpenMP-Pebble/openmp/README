    program pebble_mp.f

    OpenMP version of wave code with OpenMP directives.
    The code DOES NOT have MPI calls.

    Has the Ricker wavelet.

    Does make a GraphicsMagik movie and does write a mvlp file for Seismic Unix.

    script --> runclean.sh    deletes the working files in the data directory.


    script --> run.sh         compiles and executes the code, also cleans up
                              files from previous runs.

                              pebble.fileout is the print file from a run.
