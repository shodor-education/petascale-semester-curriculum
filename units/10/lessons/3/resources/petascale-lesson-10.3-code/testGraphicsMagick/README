     A simple image generation program to build a 
     gray scale image animation file of 10 frames.

     Each new frame has another horizontal bar 
     to show that this current image is different
     from the previous one.

     Run the script: ./runframe.sh

     This will generate .dat files in the data directory.

     Do linux command: ls -al data

     Will show the files generated by the run.

     Three file types are generated:
 
          .hdr
          .names
          .dat

     When this data directory is accessed by the mimage tool
     the .dat files are converted into .png files.

     Then using the Linux command: gm anminate -delay 10  gray*png
     A GraphicsMagick will be generated.
