    <li>Instructors and students must have access to a cluster/supercomputer with/without GPU nodes or at least a workstation/laptop.</li>

    <li>Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors that supports Fortran and C compilers on the workstation</li>
    <li>Example and exercises codes from this lesson.</li>
