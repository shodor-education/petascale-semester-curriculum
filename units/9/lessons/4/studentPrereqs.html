This lesson uses the Mandelbrot example from the “Race conditions” lesson as input for the code demonstration.  As such, it would be helpful if students had done that module.  It is not strictly necessary, however, since the example just looks at the output.

The students should be familiar with uniprocessor caching, including that each cache line stores more data than is needed to satisfy a single memory request.  They also need to be comfortable enough with C and OpenMP to understand the lab code.  The code uses a parallel block and the function calls <code>omp_get_thread_num</code> and <code>omp_get_num_threads</code> (the functions are briefly defined).

A version of the code based on explicit threading (e.g. pthreads) could presumably replace the given version, which relies on OpenMP.
