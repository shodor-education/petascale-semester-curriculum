<p>
  Before starting this lesson, students should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Familiarity with uniprocessor caching, including that each cache line
    stores more data than is needed to satisfy a single memory request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enough comfort with C and OpenMP to understand the lab code. The code uses
    a parallel block and the function calls <code>omp_get_thread_num</code>
    and <code>omp_get_num_threads</code> (the functions are briefly defined).
  </li>
  <li>
    Explored the Mandelbrot example from the "Race conditions" lesson (this
    is not strictly necessary, however, since the example just looks at the
    output).
  </li>
</ul>
