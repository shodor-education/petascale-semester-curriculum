<p>
  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Familiarity with uniprocessor caching, including that each cache line
    stores more data than is needed to satisfy a single memory request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enough comfort with C and OpenMP to understand the lab code. The code uses
    a parallel block and the function calls <code>omp_get_thread_num</code>
    and <code>omp_get_num_threads</code> (the functions are briefly defined).
  </li>
  <li>
    Tested the given code on their platform to ensure that it shows the effect
    of false sharing. In particular, they may want to customize the size of
    image being given so that the measured part of the running time is stable
    for both the false sharing (i.e. small multiplier) and non-false sharing
    (i.e. large multiplier) versions of the code.  Images of any size can be
    created by running the mandelbrot.c code from the "Race conditions" lesson
    of unit 4; simply modify the variables <code>numRows</code> and
    <code>numCols</code> (ideally keeping them the same).
  </li>
  <li>
    Explored the Mandelbrot example from the "Race conditions" lesson (this
    is not strictly necessary, however, since the example just looks at the
    output).
  </li>
