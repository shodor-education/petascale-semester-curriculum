<p>
  Before teaching this unit, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>In addition to students prerequisites, instructors should also have knowledge of the following.</li>
    <li>The instructor needs to know about the distributed memory concepts and in particular how these concepts can be expressed using MPI.</li>
    <li>The instructor has experienced how the distributed memory concepts and MPI are implemented for writing and running parallel programs including how to change a program from a single core program to a multicore program, how to fine tune the parallel program to make it scalable, etc.</li>
    <li>The instructor has access to and knows how to use a parallel computer including how to transfer files from the local to the parallel computer and vice versa, how to submit jobs to the parallel computer. </li> 
    <li>The instructor provides the students access to a parallel computer. If this access is not possible MPI can run on a single desktop computer but for the advanced examples it may be excruciatingly slow, but at least it will provide the ability to learn and test MPI concepts. </li>
    <li>The instructor has demonstrated how to use a Unix/Linux machine. </li>
</ol>
