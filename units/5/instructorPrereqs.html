<p>
  Before teaching this unit, the instructor should have, in addition to the
  student prerequisites:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Knowledge about distributed memory concepts, in particular how these
    concepts can be expressed using MPI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Experienced how distributed memory concepts and MPI are implemented for
    writing and running parallel programs, including how to change a program
    from a single core program to a multicore program, how to fine tune the
    parallel program to make it scalable, etc.
  </li>
    <li>The instructor has access to and knows how to use a parallel computer including how to transfer files from the local to the parallel computer and vice versa, how to submit jobs to the parallel computer. </li> 
    <li>The instructor provides the students access to a parallel computer. If this access is not possible MPI can run on a single desktop computer but for the advanced examples it may be excruciatingly slow, but at least it will provide the ability to learn and test MPI concepts. </li>
    <li>The instructor has demonstrated how to use a Unix/Linux machine. </li>
</ul>
