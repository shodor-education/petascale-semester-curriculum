<ol>

    <li>While it's possible to write MPI programs and execute them on multi-code workstations, in order to understand the concepts of distributed memory and analyze performance both instructors and students must have access to a cluster/supercomputer with with at least 2-4 nodes
    
    <li>Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors that supports C compilers on the workstation for modifying the code 
    
    <li>Example and exercises codes from this module.
    
    <li>A terminal interface for securing connecting to the cluster/supercomputer for compiling and running the examples and exercises.
    
    <li>Some environments may not load the necessary modules by default, use following commands for loading the correct version of the library:  
    <ol>
      
    <li>$ module avail openmpi
      
    <li>$ module load openmpi/&lt;version>
