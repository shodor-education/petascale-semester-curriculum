<p>

    By the end of this module, students will:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Have better understanding of how to measure speedup and efficiency of MPI applications

<li>Understanding of Amdahl’s Law for measuring speedup and scalability of MPI applications

<li>Able to differentiated between strong and weak scaling when measuring performance of MPI applications

<li>Have the ability to implement MPI’s time measuring routines such as MPI_Wtime() for finding the most time consuming part of code.

<li>Explore the implementation of different MPI modes either blocking vs. non-blocking or point-to-point vs collective communication modes for improving MPI application’s communications performance.
