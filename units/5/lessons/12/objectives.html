<ul>

    <li>Introduce different codes written using MPI for various scientific applications in engineering, biology, etc.
    
    <li>Real life scientific computations Open Source codes of some existing examples such as: numerical solver (Jacobi , Poisson,â€¦);in biology: smith-waterman, and pandemic simulation code, material science: simulations. 
    
    <li>Tour of codes that are being used in science and how they are distributed. 
    
    <li>What are the main fields that use MPI to solve problems? How MPI touches difference fields: n-body, pandemic;
