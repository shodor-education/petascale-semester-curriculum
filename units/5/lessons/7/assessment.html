    <li>Why use MPI collective communication routines, instead of having programmers implement a tree/butterfly structure of their own for their applications?
    
    <li>Which process(s) in the MPI communicator calls the MPI collective communication routines, especially when data exchange is required?
    
    <li>Describe a scenario where an MPI application can make use of both point-to-point communication as well as collective communication routines?
