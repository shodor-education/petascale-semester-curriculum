<p>
  By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Measure speedup and efficiency of MPI applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand Amdahl's Law for measuring speedup and scalability of MPI
    applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Differentiate between strong and weak scaling when measuring performance of
    MPI applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement MPI's time measuring routines such as MPI_Wtime() for finding the
    most time consuming part of code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explore the implementation of different MPI modes either blocking vs.
    non-blocking or point-to-point vs collective communication modes for
    improving MPI applicationâ€™s communications performance.
  </li>
</ul>
