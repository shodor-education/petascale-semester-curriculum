<p>
  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Access to a compute node cluster/supercomputer or workstation with the
    OpenMPI library installed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding of cluster computers/supercomputer architectures and what kind
    of scientific applications could benefit from them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Familiarity with the <a href="https://top500.org/">Top500 List</a> of world
    supercomputers.
  </li>
  <li>Experience programming in C/C++ as well as the MPI library</li>
  <li>
    Understanding of problem decomposition and distributed memory parallelism
    concepts as well as understanding of different MPI modes for communication
    such as blocking vs. non-blocking and collective communication algorithms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Checked with the <a
    href="https://www.open-mpi.org/">Open MPI Organization/Community</a> for any
    new releases and changes to the OpenMPI library and make necessary
    modifications to the examples and exercises.
  </li>
</ul>
