This folder contains the examples userd to for performance evaluation of MPI applications on BW

The GalaxSee-v2 folder contains:
    - The code (*.c, *.h) for an n-body simulation of multiple interacting objects developped by 
      David A. Joiner from Kean University. 
      for more information: http://shodor.org/petascale/materials/UPModules/NBody/

    - mpi_jobs.sbatch: SLURM batch script. This is an example of submitting jobs using batch scripts.
	To run the script:
		$ sbatch mpi_jobs.sbatch

    - *.gal: sample input files for the simulatione.

How to compile:
	Compile without graphical simulation from the parent folder:
	$ make NO_X11=1 build-all

	To compile from teh GalaxSee-v2 simulation folder:
	$ make NO_X11=1
	
	To clean:
	$ make clean-all
	
	If compiling with NetCDF, FFTW, make sure to uncomment the appropriate flag in the Makefile.
	
how to run:
	$ time mpirun -np 4 GalaxSee-v2/Galaxsee-v2.c-mpi simple.gal


Pre-requisites: openmpi/3.1.2, intel/2018.3, and pgi/19.4

OUTPUT:
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) nixpkgs/16.09   (S)      3) gcccore/.5.4.0  (H)   5) ifort/.2016.4.258 (H)   7) openmpi/2.1.1 (m)
  2) imkl/11.3.4.258 (math)   4) icc/.2016.4.258 (H)   6) intel/2016.4      (t)   8) StdEnv/2016.4 (S)


	- To get list of all available modules
		$ module avail

	- To swap two modules
		$ module swap StdEnv/2016.4 StdEnv/2018.3
OUTPUT:
The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) StdEnv/2016.4 => StdEnv/2018.3         4) ifort/.2016.4.258 => ifort/.2018.3.222     7) openmpi/2.1.1 => openmpi/3.1.2
  2) gcccore/.5.4.0 => gcccore/.7.3.0       5) imkl/11.3.4.258 => imkl/2018.3.222
  3) icc/.2016.4.258 => icc/.2018.3.222     6) intel/2016.4 => intel/2018.3

NOTE: Each module might have dependencies. When you swap them, it will also swap the necessary dependency modules as well.
For example, we can see that 7) openmpi/2.1.1 was swapped in the new environemnt with the openmpi/3.1.2 release.

	- To get list of all pgi modules
		$ module spider pgi

	- To get more information on a specific version of the module
		$ module spider pgi/19.4

	- To load a specifi module version for a compiler
		$ module load pgi/19.4
OUTPUT:
Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/2018.3" with "pgi/19.4".

Inactive Modules:
  1) openmpi/3.1.2

NOTE: If you just load a module instead of swap, it will automatically unlaod the another version, or type of compiler/software
including its dependencies. In this case the modules program auto unloaded intel compiler, and since openmpi depends on intel
compiler, it became inactive.
