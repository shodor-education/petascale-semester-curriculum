    While it is possible to write MPI programs and execute them on multi-core
    workstations, in order to understand the concepts of distributed memory and
    analyze performance, both instructors and students must have access to a
    cluster/supercomputer with with at least 2-4 nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors that support C compilers on the
    workstation for modifying the code.

  <li>Example and exercises codes from this lesson.</li>
  <li>
    A terminal interface for securely connecting to a cluster/supercomputer
    for compiling and running the examples and exercises.

    Some environments may not load the necessary modules by default, use
    following commands for loading the correct version of the library:
    <ul>
      <li>$ module avail openmpi</li>
      <li>$ module load openmpi/&lt;version&gt;</li>
    </ul>
