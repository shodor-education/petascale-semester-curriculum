	<li>While it's possible to write MPI programs and execute them on multi-code workstations, in order to understand the concepts of distributed memory and analyze performance both instructors and students must have access to a cluster/supercomputer with with at least 2-4 nodes</li> 
	<li>Python 3.X with MPI4PY installed</li> 
	<li>Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors for modifying the code</li> 
	<li>Example and exercises codes from this module.</li> 
	<li>A terminal interface for securing connecting to the cluster/supercomputer for compiling and running the examples and exercises.</li> 
	<li>Some environments may not load the necessary modules by default, use following commands for loading the correct version of the library: </li> 
	<ol>
		<li>$ module avail openmpi</li> 
		<li>$ module load openmpi/&lt;version><br></li>
