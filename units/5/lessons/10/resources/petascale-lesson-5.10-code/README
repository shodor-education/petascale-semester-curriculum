       The mimage graphics supports all four lessons.

       Lessons in this package:
       MPI-Waves
       MPI-OpenMP-Pebble
       OpenACC-Pebble
       Vis-Movie

       Animation tool directory:
       mimage

       Data cleanup tools:
       superls.sh
       superclean.sh

       Some simple test codes:
       MAKEtest
       mmatMultiply
       testGraphicsMagick

       ----------------  

       superls.sh shows the contents for the movie loop data directories

         these data/pebb*png files can get really big and superls
         makes a listing of them.

         the MPI codes write temporary files for making movies

         these files are in the temp_fort directories

       superclean.sh removes these data files.....
