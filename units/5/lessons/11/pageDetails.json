	"description": "This module focuses on using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for accelerating a time dependent partial differential equation scientific application. The module introduces a multi-processor parallel computing paradigm using message passing. The acoustic wave equation is computed for a two-dimensional domain. The time dependent partial differential equation is solved, and a file written to generate a visual animation. The program results are presented in a grey scale ImageMagik movie loop.",
