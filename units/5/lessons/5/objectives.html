  By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Recall different codes written using MPI for various scientific
    applications in engineering, biology, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recall real life scientific computations and open source codes of some
    existing examples such as: numerical solver (Jacobi, Poisson, ...); in
    biology: Smith-Waterman and pandemic simulation codes; materials science
    simulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recall a tour of codes that are being used in science and how they are
    distributed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know the main fields that use MPI to solve problems and how MPI touches
    different fields of n-body and pandemic.
  </li>
</ul>
