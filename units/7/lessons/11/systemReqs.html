  Students will need hardware access to run CUDA enabled code. This might be use
  of an NVIDIA card on their own PC or laptop, or a GPU enabled cluster node, or
  a Colab notebook. The code is presented as a colab notebook. If students
  intend to run as such, they should make sure the runtime environment in the
  notebook is set to GPU.
