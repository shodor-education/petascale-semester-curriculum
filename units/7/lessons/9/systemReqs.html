  Students will need access to a machine with GPU hardware with the NVIDIA CUDA
  toolkit and compiler installed.
</p>
<p>
  One option for this is a Colab notebook. Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks
  provided by Google and powered by a Google virtual machine, with the option of
  using GPU hardware.

  Colab notebooks can be set to have a runtime type of GPU, which will give the
  students access to a K80 GPU card in the virtual machine powering the
  notebook. An example Colab sheet is provided which shows how to set up the
  cells in the notebook to write, compile, and run on the underlying virtual
  machine.
