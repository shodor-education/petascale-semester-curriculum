The instructor should have a thorough understanding of the CUDA language as methods of GPGPU based parallelism. This module will require compiling and running a pre-written code in CUDA, along with minor modifications to tailor block and grid size to the hardware on which the example will be run. The instructor should be prepared to explain the concept of a warp in GPGPU programming, and the synchronization of instructions across all threads in a warp.
