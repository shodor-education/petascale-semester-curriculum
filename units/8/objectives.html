<p>
The agenda for the meeting is to go over the modules in the Unit 8: OpenACC:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Reorganize/order modules to create a better flow between them</li>
    <li>Write Unit's Learning Objective</li>
    <li>Unit Student Prerequisites</li>
    <li>Unit Sample Assessment</li>
    <li>Unit Instructor Prerequisites</li>
</ol>
<p>
Modules Description:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>8.1: Wave equations:  
	<ul>
 		<li>Student prerequisites: working knowledge of OpenACC, Introduction to OpenACC (Module 8.2), Access to accelerated hardware
 		<li>Instructor Prerequisites:</li> 
	</ul>
	<li>8.2: The objective of this module to have students get started with accelerating their application by simply adding compiler directives. By end of this module students will have a better understanding when to use Parallel loop and as programmer to ensure safe parallelism vs using OpenACC Kernels and have compiler analyze the code and parallelize the compute intensive parts.  </li>
	<li>8.3:</li>
	<li>8.4:</li>
	<li>8.5:</li>
	<li>8.6:</li>
</ul>
<p>
Reorder Modules:
</p>
<p>
8.1 Intro to OpenACC
</p>
<p>
8.2 Accelerating Scientific Applications
</p>
<p>
8.3: Suggested: Something using Linear Algebra that is the same application as in the OpenMP unit
</p>
<p>
8.4: Suggested: OpenACC accelerated computational chemistry
</p>
<p>
8.5: Suggested: N-Body Mechanics in OpenACC
</p>
<p>
8.6: (open to any module for now)
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using Compiler tuning tools for performance analysis (mobeen)</li>
	<li>Bad examples for GPU acceleration (Phill)</li>
</ul>
