  "title": "Unit 8 Lesson 1: Accelarating Scientific Applications",
  "description": "This lesson focuses on OpenACC's compiler directives for accelerating a time dependent partial differential equation scientific application. The lesson introduces two methods of parallelizing: First: where the programmer has the ability to control the data copy from host to/from the Graphics Processing Unit and understand compute flow improvements. Second: where the compiler actually controls speedup for computations and plans the required data flow. The program results are presented in a grey scale ImageMagik movie loop.",
