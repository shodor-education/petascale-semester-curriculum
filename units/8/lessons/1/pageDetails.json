	"description": "This module will focus on OpenACC's compiler directives for accelerating a time dependent partial differential equation scientific application. The module will introduce two methods of parallelizing: First: where the programmer has the ability to control the data copy from host to/from the Graphics Processing Unit and understand compute flow improvements. Second: where the compiler actually controls speedup for computations and plans the required data flow. The program results are presented in a grey scale ImageMagik movie loop.",
