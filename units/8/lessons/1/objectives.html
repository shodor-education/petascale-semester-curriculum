<p>
  By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know what is heterogenous memory/computing with OpenACC and its use cases.</li>
  <li>Find the compute intensive parts of programs.</li>
  <li>Understand the two methods for adding compiler directives:
    <ul>
      <li>One where the program flow and data flow is controlled by the programmer.</li>
      <li>One where all the work is left for the compiler to decide which loops to parallelize and how to copy data between CPU &lt;=&gt; GPU.</li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid bad practices in OpenACC programming that could lead to potential performance issues.</li>
  <li>Accelerating scientific applications using PGI compiler.</li>
</ul>
