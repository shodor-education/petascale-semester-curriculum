<p>
    By the end of this module, students will:
    </p>
    <ul>
    
    <li>Knowledge of what is heterogenous memory/computing with OpenACC and its use cases.
    
    <li>How to find the compute intensive parts of programs.
    
    <li>Understand the two methods for adding compiler directives: 
    <ul>
     
    <li>One where the program flow and data flow is controlled by the programmer.
     
    <li>One where all the work is left for the compiler to decide which loops to parallelize and how to copy data between CPU &lt;=> GPU.
    </li> 
    </ul>
    
    <li>Learn by example how to avoid bad practices in OpenACC programming that could lead to potential performance issues.
    
    <li>Hands-on examples and exercises for accelerating scientific applications using PGI compiler.
    </li>
    </ul>
