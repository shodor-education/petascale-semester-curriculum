<p>
    By the end of this lesson, students will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Knowledge of what is heterogenous memory/computing with OpenACC and its use cases.</li>
    <li>How to find the compute intensive parts of programs.</li>
    <li>Understand the two methods for adding compiler directives: </li>
    <ul>
    	<li>One where the program flow and data flow is controlled by the programmer.</li>
    	<li>One where all the work is left for the compiler to decide which loops to parallelize and how to copy data between CPU &lt;=> GPU.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li>Learn by example how to avoid bad practices in OpenACC programming that could lead to potential performance issues.</li>
    <li>Hands-on examples and exercises for accelerating scientific applications using PGI compiler.</li>
</ul>
