    Instructors and students must have access to a cluster/supercomputer with
    GPU nodes or at least a workstation with GPU accelerator(s).

  <li>
    Most supercomputers will have the PGI toolkit installed. If not, a request
    for installation of new tools must be submitted. If using a workstation,
    make sure the PGI community edition of the toolkit is installed.

  <li>
    Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors that support Fortran and C compilers
    on the workstation.
