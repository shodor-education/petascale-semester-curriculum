    <li>Instructors and students must have access to a cluster/supercomputer with GPU nodes or at least a workstation with GPU accelerator(s)
    
    <li>Most supercomputers will have PGI toolkit installed. If not, a request for installation of new tools must be submitted. If using a workstation, make sure the PGI community edition of the toolkit is installed.
    
    <li>Emacs, Vim, or any other code editors that supports Fortran and C compilers on the workstation
    
    <li>Example and exercises codes from this module.
    </li>
    </ul>

    An interactive job run system is very desirable, i.e., not a batch job queue submission system.
