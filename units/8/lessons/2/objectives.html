<ol>
	 <li>Knowledge of what is OpenACC and its user cases</li>
	 <li>Understand the two methods for adding compiler directives: </li>
	 <ol>
		  <li>One where the program flow and data flow is controlled by the programmer</li>
		  <li>One where all the work is left for the compiler to decide which loops to parallelize and how to copy data between CPU &lt;=> GPU</li> 
	 </ol>
	 <li>Learn by example how to avoid bad practices in OpenACC programming that could lead to potential performance issues</li>
