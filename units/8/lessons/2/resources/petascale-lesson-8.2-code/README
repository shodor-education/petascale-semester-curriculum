This folder contains the examples and exerciese used in the Introduction to OpenACC module

The examples folder contains:
    - vect_add.c:   This is the first and simple vector addition example that shows
        primmary directives for creating parallel regions, and copying data between host and device (accelarator)

    - laplace_bad_acc.c:   This example demonostrate the use of OpenACC Kernel directives that also takes care of data
        Compilers may not be very good at recognizing when to move which data from host to device or vice versa.
        Therefore, creating a data region with #pragma acc data directive would solve the issue.

    - laplace_acc.c     This example show a more correct way of using openacc kernel directives.

    - Makefile:     This make file could be used to compile and build the example codes.
        The make file can be modified to add any other compilers or platforms. It gives the option of selecting
        the platform and system and will compile with appropriate flags.

    gpu_modules: this file has information for different platforms PGI, Cray, GNU on BW and which modules you
        need to load based on the desired environment.
