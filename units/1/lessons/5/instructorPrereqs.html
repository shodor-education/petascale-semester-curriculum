<p>
	Prior to teaching this lesson, the instructor should understand and be able to do the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have access to a supercomputer and be able to provide access for the students taking the course. This should
		include contacts that the students can reach out to for login issues, issues with running jobs/accessing the
		supercomputer, etc.</li>
	<li>Be able to show the students how to run a basic example (and be able to show the students what lessons, if any,
		should be loaded to run a basic program) and how to request a compute node, whether through <code>aprun</code>,
		<code>srun</code>, or some other keyword. Instructions for using and running with <code>aprun</code>will be
		provided, but if the system that the instructor has access to uses a different system for running jobs, the
		instructor will have to provide this information themselves.</li>
</ol>
