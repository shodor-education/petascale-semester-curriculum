!!   how to use a Makefile for Fortran

     The Makefile has a list of the main porgrams and subroutines needed.
     
      Command make clean ->> will remove all the compiler .o files from the last compile.
      Command make  ->> will compile these programs and subroutines.
                        then builds an executable for the main program.

      The User the runs the following command: ./my_main_program

      Here the main program is: main.f 
      The subroutines are:      hello.f
                                factorial.f

      COMMAND LINE:  make clean         !!  does the cleaning
      COMMAND LINE:  make               !!  does the make
      COMMAND LINE:  ./main             !!  run the main
