    3) Students will learn parallel programming patterns to achieve peak parallel performance.
    </p>
    <p>
    4) Student will be able to describe the sources of parallel overhead, performance metrics and scalability of the parallel system
    </p>
    <p>
    5) Students will learn to “think in parallel” by examining several parallel problems including vector/matrix addition, sorting numbers, and random number generation.
