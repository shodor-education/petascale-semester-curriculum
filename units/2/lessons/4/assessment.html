    <li>What does it mean if an algorithm is <strong>embarrassingly parallel</strong>?

    <li>Assume you have a vector with one million numbers. Assume you also have a CPU with 4 processing cores. How could
        you use all 4 cores to sum up all the values in the vector utilizing a parallel approach to speed up the
        computation?

    <li>For each of the following options, would a <strong>serial</strong> or <strong>parallel</strong> program be
        better suited for the task, and <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">why</span></em>?
