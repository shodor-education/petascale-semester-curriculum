<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the difference between a shared memory system and a distributed
    memory system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Categorize common parallel programming tools, including OpenMP, MPI, and
    PThreads, as either shared memory or distributed memory approaches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the key performance metrics related to memory access to compare a
    shared memory system with a distributed memory system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define key concepts in distributed memory systems, including bisection
    bandwidth and redundancy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Estimate the number of links needed in a distributed memory system with a
    given architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Estimate the number of "hops" a message needs in a distributed memory system
    with a given architecture. (Is this too many?)
  </li>
</ul>
