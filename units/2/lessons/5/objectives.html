    <li>Describe the key performance metrics related to memory access to compare a shared memory system with a
        distributed memory system.

    <li>Define key concepts in distributed memory systems, including bisection bandwidth, redundancy, … (Other terms?)

    <li>Estimate the number of links needed in a distributed memory system with a given architecture.

    <li>Estimate the number of “hops” a message needs in a distributed memory system with a given architecture. (Is this
