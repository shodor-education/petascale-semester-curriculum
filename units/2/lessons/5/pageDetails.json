  "title": "Unit 2 Lesson 5: Shared Memory and Distributed Memory & Interconnection Networks",
  "description": "This lesson describes the difference between a shared memory system and a distributed memory system. The lesson categorizes common parallel programming tools, including OpenMP, MPI, and PThreads, as either shared memory or distributed memory approaches. The lesson also describes the key performance metrics related to memory access to compare a shared memory system with a distributed memory system. The lesson defines key concepts in distributed memory systems, including bisection bandwidth, and redundancy. Students will estimate the number of links needed in a distributed memory system with a given architecture and estimate the number of \"hops\" a message needs in a distributed memory system with a given architecture.",
