  This lesson begins to touch on the following topics in the
  <strong>ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sequential vs. parallel processing</strong> as described under the
    section <em>SF. Systems Fundamentals.</em>, subsection
    <em>SF/Parallelism</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple simultaneous computations</strong> as described under the
    section <em>Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD), </em>subsection
    <em>PD/Parallelism Fundamentals</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Naturally (embarrassingly) parallel algorithms</strong> as described
    under the section <em>Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD)</em>,
    subsection <em>PD/Parallel Algorithms, Analysis, and Programming</em>.
  </li>
</ul>
