    Before teaching this lesson the instructor should be familiar with the following topics:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

    1. Data parallelism
</p>
<p>

    2. Task parallelism
</p>
<p>

    3. Basic computer program design
</p>
<p>

    4. Basic computer programing algorithms
</p>
<p>

    5. Understanding of galaxy formation (n-body problem), building several computers (assembly line), matrix
    multiplication, Gaussian elimination, and finding the area under a curve. Here enough background is needed to
    identify data and task parallelism and lead a discussion about those topics.
