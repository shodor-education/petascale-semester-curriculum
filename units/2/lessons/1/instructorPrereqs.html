<p>
	Before teaching this lesson the instructor should be familiar with the following topics:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Data parallelism</li>
	<li>Task parallelism</li>
	<li>Basic computer program design</li>
	<li>Basic computer programing algorithms</li>
	<li>Understanding of galaxy formation (n-body problem), building several computers (assembly line), matrix
		multiplication, Gaussian elimination, and finding the area under a curve. Here enough background is needed to
		identify data and task parallelism and lead a discussion about those topics.</li>
