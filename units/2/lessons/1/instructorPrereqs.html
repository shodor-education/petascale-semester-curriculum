<p>
  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarity with data parallelism.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with task parallelism.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with basic computer program design.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with basic computer programing algorithms.</li>
  <li>
    Understanding of galaxy formation (n-body problem), building several
    computers (assembly line), matrix multiplication, Gaussian elimination, and
    finding the area under a curve. Here enough background is needed to identify
    data and task parallelism and lead a discussion about those topics.
  </li>
</ul>
