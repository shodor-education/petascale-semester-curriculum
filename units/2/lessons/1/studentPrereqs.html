  Before starting this lesson, students should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of a programming language (functional or
    object-oriented programming is fine).
  </li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of algorithm design at the pseudocode level (e.g., a
    simple sorting or searching algorithm, or calling multiple functions to
    solve a problem).
  </li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of mathematics, specifically: Gaussian elimination,
    matrix multiplication, basic integration of a polynomial (area under the
    curve â€“ Calculus I material).
  </li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of designing a high-level algorithm or process to
    solve a given problem using pseudocode.
  </li>
</ul>
