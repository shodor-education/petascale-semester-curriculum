    No materials or other requirements are needed for this module. The slides provide a basis for an
    introductory/overview lecture and the homework problems provide exercises for students to work either in-class or at
    home. The lecture slides include three in-class example problems. It is suggested to have the students work the
    homework problems on their own and then present solutions during class with a discussion period for each problem.
