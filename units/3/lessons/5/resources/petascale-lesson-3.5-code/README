This folder contains the examples used to show how to compile and run different parallel code on Stampede2 supercomputer.

Pre-requisites: module load impi

The examples folder contains:
    - mpi_example.c: this is a simple mpi program prints which MPI process is running on which Core of which node.
    - runbatch.sh: SLURM batch script. This is an example of submitting jobs using batch scripts.
	To run the script:
		$ ./runbatch.sh [executable file]

    - omp_pi_area.c: Simple yet a more scientific example showing how to use OpenMP Reduction clause.
	This example is used to show how to compile and run OpenMP code on Cedar Compute Canada's cluster.
	$ make omp_pi_area

    - acc_laplace.c:  Simple yet a more scientific example showing how to use OpenACC compiler directives.
	This example will show how to swich compilers from intel to pgi, and compile and run OpenACC code
	$ make acc_laplace

   - mpi_pi_area: Simple yet a more scientific example showing how to use collective communcation
	routines such as MPI_Bcast and MPI_Reduce as well as some MPI timing routines. This example will show
	how to compile and run code using openmpi/3.1.2 module.
	$ make mpi_pi_area
    - Makefile:   This make file could be used to compile and build the example codes.
        The make file can be modified to add any other compilers or platforms. It gives the option of selecting
        the platform and system and will compile with appropriate flags.
