<p>Assessments in this lesson are geared toward understanding speedup, Amdahl’s Law, and Gustafson’s Law. Assessments can be issued under the form of providing the parallel or serial portion of a program and asking students to calculate potential speed up given a certain number of additional processors. </p>
<p>Another way to frame the question is that assuming a research wants their program to run X times faster (speedup), and they know the serial proportion of this program, is it possible to add more resources to do this, and how many. </p>
