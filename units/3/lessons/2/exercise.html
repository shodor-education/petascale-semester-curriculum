Problem 1:  Unroll the following pseudocode loop 4.  Assume that array y has 16 elements.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Array y is an array of integers
</p>
<p>
FOR x = 1 to n 
</p>
<p>
            y[x] = y[x] * 7
</p>
<p>
END FOR
</p>

Problem 2:  Estimate the performance improvement of running the unrolled loop on a vector architecture compared to the original (unrolled loop) code.  Assume that each array update instruction takes time A and that 1 check and update of the loop conditions requires time 2A.

Problem 3:  Apply Foster’s methodology to the solar system modeling problem for a solar system with 9 planets.  Make sure to identify one or more types of processing elements in Flynn’s taxonomy would be appropriate for your algorithm to run on and justify your selection(s).
