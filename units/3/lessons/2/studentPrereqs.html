Before starting this lesson students should have:
</p>

<ol>

<li>A basic understanding of the stored program concept and that problem data must be stored in memory.</li>
<li>Have seen a GPU (SIMD), and CPU (SISD) before.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of how programs are executed on a computer – instructions are used to tell the CPU what to do and data are processed.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of caches and how they are used in computing.  Understanding that they are a small and fast memory is sufficient.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of data access and memory access times.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of how to create a plan to solve a given problem for the Foster’s methodology material– not necessarily how to design software, but if they have written any code that is fine.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of loops.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of Foster’s methodology.  Material from lesson 3.1 is sufficient for this item.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of Flynn’s taxonomy.  Material from lesson 3.1 is sufficient for this item.</li>
