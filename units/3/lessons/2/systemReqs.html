<p>
  No materials or other requirements are needed for this lesson. The slides
  provide a basis for an introductory/overview lecture, and the homework
  problems provide exercises for students to work either in-class or at home.
  The slides contain an example that can be worked through in class or a
  combination of in and out of class work. It is suggested to have the students
  work the homework problems on their own and then present solutions during
  class with a discussion period for each problem.
