<li>Gain experience predicting performance of a loop on a vector architecture</li>

<li>Understand how to employ Fosterâ€™s methodology (see: Designing and Building Parallel Programs, by Ian Foster, available at: https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~itf/dbpp/ ) for designing parallel programs for a given architecture
