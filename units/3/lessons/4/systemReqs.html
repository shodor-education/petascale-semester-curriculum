<p>
  No materials or other requirements are needed for this module except a web
  browser to spend some time reviewing the previous lessons about Connecting to
  a Cluster and Using the Linux Command Line. The students should also have
  sufficient privileges to install software on their machines, and of course
  have an internet connection.
