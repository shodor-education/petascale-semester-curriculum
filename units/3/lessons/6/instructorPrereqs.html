<p>
Before teaching this lesson, the instruction should have:
</p>
<ol>

<li>experience with using a cluster computer or a national supercomputer. This lesson focuses on using the Cedar supercomputer at Simon Fraser University, and the software environment and applications supported by Compute Canada. However, most supercomputer environments and tools for running applications on clusters are fairly similar and can easily be modified from one to another. Schedulers can be optimized for different system architectures, and they have different algorithms for scheduling. However, for  end users the difference is only visible at the syntax level.</li>

<li>Experience using different scheduler and able to modify or convert scripts from one to another</li>

<li>Experience using schedulerâ€™s environment variables for controlling the flow of running applications on different systems and specific hardware codes</li>

<li>Experience implementing Multi-Threaded, Multi-Process, and GPGPU applications and development environments.</li>
</ol>
