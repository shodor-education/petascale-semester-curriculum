<p>
  Before teaching this lesson, the instructor should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Experience with using a cluster computer or a national supercomputer. This
    lesson focuses on using the Cedar supercomputer at Simon Fraser University,
    and the software environment and applications supported by Compute Canada.
    However, most supercomputer environments and tools for running applications
    on clusters are fairly similar and can easily be modified from one to
    another. Schedulers can be optimized for different system architectures, and
    they have different algorithms for scheduling. However, for end users the
    difference is only visible at the syntax level.
  </li>
  <li>
    Experience using different scheduler and able to modify or convert scripts
    from one to another.
  </li>
  <li>
    Experience using scheduler's environment variables for controlling the flow
    of running applications on different systems and specific hardware codes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Experience implementing Multi-Threaded, Multi-Process, and GPGPU
    applications and development environments.
  </li>
</ul>
