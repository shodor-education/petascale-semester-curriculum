No materials or other requirements are needed for this module.  
</p>
<p>
The PowerPoint slides provide a basis for an introductory/overview lecture and the homework problems provide exercises for students to work either in-class or at home.  The PowerPoint slides should cover the 20-25 minutes with the homework problems reinforcing and expanding on the material.  The PowerPoint slides are in a very basic format to simplify customization to a desired background.

<p>
It is suggested to have the students work the homework problems on their own and then present solutions during class with a discussion period for each problem.  The homework problems can be extended to increase difficulty or this can be used to help facilitate discussion during the in-class discussion of the problems.
