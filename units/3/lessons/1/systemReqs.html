<p>
No materials or other requirements are needed for this module.  The slides provide a basis for an introductory/overview lecture and the homework problems provide exercises for students to work either in-class or at home.  It is suggested to have the students work the homework problems on their own and then present solutions during class with a discussion period for each problem.
