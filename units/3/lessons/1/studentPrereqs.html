Before starting this lesson students should have:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

    1.     A basic understanding of the stored program concept and that problem data must be stored in memory.
</p>
<p>

    2.     Have seen a GPU (SIMD), and CPU (SISD) before.
</p>
<p>

    3.     A basic understanding of how programs are executed on a computer – instructions are used to tell the CPU what to do and data are processed.
</p>
<p>

    4.     A basic understanding of caches and how they are used in computing.  Understanding that they are a small and fast memory is sufficient.
</p>
<p>

    5.     A basic understanding of data access and memory access times.
</p>
<p>

    6.     A basic understanding of how to create a plan to solve a given problem for the Foster’s methodology material– not necessarily how to design software, but if they have written any code that is fine.
