  Before starting this lesson, students should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of the stored program concept and that problem data
    must be stored in memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    Seen a GPU (SIMD) and CPU (SISD) before.
  </li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of how programs are executed on a computer &mdash;
    instructions are used to tell the CPU what to do and data are processed.
  </li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of caches and how they are used in computing.
    Understanding that they are a small and fast memory is sufficient.
  </li>
  <li>A basic understanding of data access and memory access times.</li>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of how to create a plan to solve a given problem for
    the Foster's methodology material &mdash; not necessarily how to design
    software, but if they have written any code that is fine.
  </li>
</ul>
