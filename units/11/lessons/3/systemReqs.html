  It is highly recommended that students use a laptop or desktop computer to
  complete each lesson. It is highly recommended that students have a high-speed
  internet connection and ready access to a multi-core, multi-CPU Linux or Unix
  computer, preferably a high-performance computing cluster, with at least 256
  MB of total memory and at least 1 GB of disk space. Students should have
  access to and a rudimentary understanding of the C and Python programming
  languages, a C compiler, GNU make, MPI library (mpicc and mpirun), and if
  necessary, minimal experience with job scheduling (slurm or PBS).
