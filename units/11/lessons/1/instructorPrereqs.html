    Before teaching this module, the instructor should be familiar with basic concepts and applications behind the following simulation methods:  Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics(MD), Monte Carlo(MC), Mesoscopic Coarse Grained MD/MC and Lattice Boltzmann Method, Continuum Conservation Equation solvers. The instructor should also be familiar with the concept of machine learning.  Lastly, the instructor should understand the diffraction limit of light microscopy, in order to motivate the need for computation by explaining the technological limitations of experimental equipment.
