<p>
  Before starting this lesson, students should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A basic understanding of Physics and Chemistry. For example, they should
    know F=m*a.
  </li>
  <li>
    A general understanding of different types of force interactions (e.g.,
    columb, van der waals, hydrogen bonding).
  </li>
  <li>
    Comfort with terms like viscosity and density.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideally heard of the Schr√∂dinger Equation, but this is not critical.
  </li>
</ul>
