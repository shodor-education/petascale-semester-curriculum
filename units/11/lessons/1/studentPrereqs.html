    <li>A basic understanding of Physics and Chemistry. For example, they should know: F=m*a; have a general
        understanding of different types of force interactions (e.g., columb, van der waals, hydrogen bonding); be
        comfortable with terms like viscosity and density. It would be nice if they have heard of the Schr√∂dinger
        Equation, but this is not critical.</li>
