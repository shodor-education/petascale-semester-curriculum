	"description": "Astrophysics is the domain science that uses physical principles to determine the physical nature of astronomical objects like stars, galaxies, and other large-scale structures, and to understand time-variable phenomena like supernovae, star and planet formation, stellar evolution, and galaxy evolution. The goal of computational astrophysics is to produce computer simulations to explore the behavior of a mathematical model of a particular system or process in astronomy."
